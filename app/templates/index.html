<h1>12 Days of Parkmas – Summer Edition</h1>

<p class="update-info">
    Welcome to the Parkmas Scoring System! This event runs July 12–24 and tracks
    both activators in the parks and hunters operating from home. Scoring is simple:
    activators earn points for each QSO made from a park, and hunters earn points
    for each QSO they log with an activator. Full scoring details will be added here soon.
